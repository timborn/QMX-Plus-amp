----------------------------
- RF paths need wide copper.  How wide?  Figure out netclasses
- +12V probably needs a wide path as well for all that current (HOW MUCH?)
- want K1 & K2 to be *identical* even tho they appear in multiple schematic
  pages.  I want the control signals on one, and the RF paths on another.
  So far all I get are complaints about duplicate symbols, even when I 
  copy / paste special.
